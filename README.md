# covid_cases_by_county
This code plots simple time series plots of cases from NYTimes data available [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

New cases and new deaths for each day are determined from subtracting the cases of a day from the previous day. These are raw numbers and not per capita.
