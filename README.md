# COVID cases by US county
This code plots simple time series data of cases and deaths made available from the  NYTimes (see [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)).

New cases and new deaths for each day are determined from subtracting the cases of a day from the previous day. These are raw numbers and not per capita which is important to put in context. In addition, the numbers are likely underestimated since widespread testing is not yet available.

I created this as a simple way to update friends and family early in the early stages of the pandemic. I encourage you to go to
