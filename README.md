# COVID cases by US county
This code plots simple time series data of cases and deaths made available from the  NYTimes (see [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)).

New cases and new deaths for each day are determined from subtracting the cases of a day from the previous day. These are raw numbers and not per capita.
